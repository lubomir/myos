Ideally, upon booting this kernel should list contents of root file system and
display contents of one file. However, on my machine it currently fails with
page fault.

To run the code, follow these commands:

    $ git clone https://github.com/lubomir/myos.git
    $ cd myos
    $ git checkout fat
    $ make run-qemu


This code is heavily inspired by JamesM's kernel development tutorial [0] and
OSdev wiki [1].
