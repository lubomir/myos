The keymap is stored in 256 bytes. First 128 bytes correspond to scancodes
emitted when in scan code set 1, the second 128 bytes are used when Shift key
is pressed.

There is a gen-keymap utility in tools/, that can create a binary file with
keymap definition. It expects two command line arguments - input and output
file.

The input file has simple text format: each line defines one entry in the
keymap table and has format of either:

    idx=val
    idx:code

Where `idx` is the index in the table to be set to either `val` (which is the
printable character itself) or to character which ASCII code is `code`. The
code is specified in decadic notation.

All values that are not specified are set to 0.

Empty lines are ignored, as is anything after the `val` or `code` part of line
or any leading whitespace or space around operator.
